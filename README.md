# MyPortfolio
This week, I build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Main things about the assignment 
***
* Most of the text are links so they can take you to sections of the website
* When you click on my works they take you to that deployed application 
* You can check out my GitHub account and see the things I'm working on and even email me in the contact section
* the website adjusts for different screen sizes so thats nice but only a little
